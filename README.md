# Leaderboard API | Hit the API.

For this repository, I've created a project to add functionalities from API such as adding POST and GET methods to access the data from the cloud, also I've implemented a dynamic web app using the data extracted by the cloud using the API, and the form to create new data to send to the cloud.

I used Webpack to manage the files for the front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more additional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
